I lived in Buenos Aires, in maaany other neighbourhoods (when I left my parents house, I kept moving in and out), for almost the rest of my life in Argentina. <br>I was an <b>English teacher</b> for 8+ years and I can say it was one of the <b>most rewarding endeavours</b> I've undergone, but I felt it no longer fit my desired way of living.<br> At 31, I decided to live in <b>Amsterdam</b> for a year and it was an <b>amazing</b> experience, where I met people from lots of countries around the world. This served as a trigger for me, and I can't stress this enough: <i>I need to go on travelling and expanding my perspective(s) on life and others.</i><br> Apart from people and places, I also met a new passion: <b>coding</b>, thanks to a new but very close friend of mine, who is an IT Engineer and introduced me to this world by the end of 2019.<br> And here I am, almost one year since then, every day feeling more and more confident and acquiring more and more experience by the minute. ;) </p> </div>  </div> </body></html>
